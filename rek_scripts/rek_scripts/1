  -f input_file   (mandatory) Name of the SBF file(s) to be converted.
                  To convert multiple files, use a whitespace as
                  delimiter between the different file names. Each SBF
                  file is converted into a different RINEX file.
  -o output_file  Name of the output RINEX file, bypassing the standard
                  naming convention. See file naming convention below.
                  Note: do not use a forced output file name when
                  converting multiple files.
  -l              Use long file naming convention (introduced in RINEX
                  v3.02). Default is short file name. See below.
  -O CCC          Force using the specified 3-letter country code in
                  the long file name. This option is ignored if the -l
                  option is not used.
  -R version      By default, sbf2rin converts to RINEX v2.11.  Use -R3
                  to convert to the last revision (currently v3.04) or
                  -R303 to convert to v3.03.
  -n type         Type of files to be generated.  type is a combination
                  of the following characters:
                    O for an observation file (this is the default),
                    N for a GPS-only navigation file,
                    G for a GLONASS-only navigation file,
                    E for a Galileo-only navigation file (always RINEX
                      v3.xx),
                    H for a SBAS-only navigation file,
                    I for a BeiDou-only navigation file (always RINEX
                      v3.xx),
                    P for a mixed GNSS navigation file (always RINEX
                      v3.xx),
                    B for a broadcast SBAS file (all L1 and L5 messages),
                      valid only for a broadcast SBAS file (valid CRC
                      only),
                    M for a meteo file.
                  Note that QZSS navigation data is only available in
                  mixed files.
                  If multiple characters are combined, all the requested
                  RINEX files are generated at once. For example -nPOM
                  generates obs, mixed nav and meteo files.
  -MET            Generate a RINEX meteo file (same as -nM).
  -i interval     Interval in the RINEX obs and meteo file, in seconds
                  (by default, the interval is the same as in the SBF
                   file).
  -b startepoch   Time of first epoch to insert in the RINEX file.
                  Format: yyyy-mm-dd_hh:mm:ss or hh:mm:ss.
  -e endepoch     Last epoch to insert in the RINEX file
                  Format: yyyy-mm-dd_hh:mm:ss or hh:mm:ss.
  -s              Include the Sx obs types in the observation file.
  -D              Include the Dx obs types in the observation file.
  -X              Include the X1 obs types (channel number) in the
                  observation file.
                  (option only available when generating RINEX v3.xx
                   files).
  -c              Allow comments in the RINEX file (from the Comment SBF
                  block)
  -C commentstr   Add the specified comment string to the RINEX obs
                  header. The comment string must not be longer than
                  240 characters. Enclose the string between quotes if
                  it contains whitespaces.
  -U              Make sure a satellite number does not appear more than
                  once in a given epoch, which could otherwise happen when
                  the receiver is configured to track the same satellite on
                  multiple channels, or in rare cases when two GLONASS
                  satellites are using the same slot number.
  -x systems      Exclude one or more satellite systems from the obs
                  file or from the mixed navigation file.
                  systems may be G (GPS), R (Glonass), E (Galileo), S
                  (SBAS), C (Compass/Beidou), J (QZSS), I (IRNSS) or any
                  combination thereof. For instance, -xERSCJI produces
                  a GPS-only file.
  -I siglist      Include only the observables from the specified signal
                  types. By default all observables in the SBF file are
                  converted to RINEX. siglist is a list of signal types
                  separated by "+" and without whitespaces.  The
                  available signal types are:
                  GPSL1CA, GPSL1P, GPSL2P, GPSL2C, GPSL5, GPSL1C,
                  GLOL1CA, GLOL1P, GLOL2P, GLOL2CA, GLOL3,
                  GALE1, GALE5a, GALE5b, GALE5, GALE6,
                  BDSB1I, BDSB2I, BDSB3I, BDSB1C, BDSB2a, BDSB2b,
                  QZSL1CA, QZSL2C, QZSL5, QZSL1C, QZSL1S,
                  SBSL1, SBSL5,
                  IRNL5, IRNS1.
                  For example: -I GPSL1CA+GLOL1CA
  -E siglist      Exclude the observables from the specified signal
                  types. See the -I argument for a definition of siglist.
  -a antenna      Convert data from the specified antenna (antenna is 1,
                  2 or 3). The default is 1, corresponding to the main
                  antenna.
  -ma             Insert a "start moving" event right after the header
                  if the RINEX file contains kinematic data.
  -mf             Force inserting a "start moving" event right after
                  the header.
  -noevent        Do not report external events in RINEX.  Default is to
                  report external events in comment strings.
  -S              Automatically increase the file sequence character in
                  the output file name when converting multiple files
                  from the same marker and the same day. This option is
                  ignored if the -l or the -o option is also selected.
  -v              Run in verbose mode.
  -V              Display the sbf2rin version.


Note on the L2 observables in RINEX v2.11
----------------------------------------

 For GPS satellites, sbf2rin by default encodes L2P carrier phases as
 L2 observables.If the SBF file does not contain any L2P carrier phase,
 or if L2P is disabled with the -I or -E options, L2C carrier phases
 are encoded instead.

 For GLONASS satellites, sbf2rin by default encodes L2CA carrier phases
 as L2 observables. If the SBF file does not contain any L2CA carrier
 phase, or if L2CA is disabled with the -I or -E options, L2P carrier
 phases are encoded instead.

 Note that this is only applicable to RINEX v2.11.  RINEX v2.10 only
 contains L2P carrier phases, and RINEX v3 can contain both.


RINEX file naming convention
----------------------------

 By default, the RINEX 2.x naming convention is applied and the output
 file name is of the form SSSSDDDF.YYT, where SSSS is the station
 designator taken from the StationCode field of the ReceiverSetup SBF
 block, DDD is the day of year, F is the file sequence character, YY is
 the year and T is the file type. F is always 0 except when the -S
 option is used. T can be one of the following:
    O: Observation file (default)
    N: GPS navigation file (option -nN)
    G: GLONASS navigation file (option -nG)
    L: Galileo navigation file (option -nE)
    H: SBAS navigation file (option -nH)
    I: Beidou navigation file (option -nI) (Note that this extension is
       non-standard)
    P: Mixed-constellation navigation file (option -nP)
    B: SBAS broadcast data file (option -nB)
    M: Meteorological data file (option -MET)
 
 With the "-o copy" option, the name of the RINEX file is a copy of the
 name of the SBF file, with only the last character being changed to the
 file type character as defined above.
 
 With the "-o copybase" option, the name of the RINEX file is a copy of
 the name of the SBF file, with the last 3 characters being set to "YYT".
 
 With the -l option, the file name conforms to the long file name
 convention introduced with RINEX v3.02.  The station designator and the
 country code are taken from the ReceiverSetup SBF block.  The country
 code can be overwritten with the -O argument.

 The RINEX files are put in the current directory.
